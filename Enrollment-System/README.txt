## UP Admissions Portal 
# College Admissions Simulator

This is a simple web application using HTML, PHP, and JavaScript along with a MySQL database.

## How to use:
1. Extract the contents of this zip file.
2. Copy all files and directories to the htdocs directory inside xampp (for example: C:\xampp\htdocs\Enrollment-System), where "Enrollment-System" will contain all of the files.
3. Import the database [portal_college.sql] in phpmyadmin or directly embed it into your MySQL database through the command prompt (refer to this link on how - https://www.warp.dev/terminus/mysql-import-sql-file). 
4. Open your XAMPP Panel and make sure to start your APACHE and MySQL 'Modules' under 'Actions' (refer to this link, if you do not have XAMPP, yet - https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
5. Open any browser, enter localhost, and browse the file location on the search bar. (i.e. localhost/Enrollment-System)

Note:
When logging in as an ADMIN, the login information was set as follows,

But, this can be modified within the login_check.php file
